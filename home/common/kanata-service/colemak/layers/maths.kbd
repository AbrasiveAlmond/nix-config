;; notes on experience thus far
;; much fewer occurances of sfbs than compared to num-pad style layouts.
;; dashes-between words much easier with alt_symbols layout
;; lefthand index finger feels like its flying

;; top is somewhat symmetric with left/right having inverse operators
;; bottom row has many common variables, 
;; but no access to other common letters y, t, or n.
